Trying to keep my own projects honest by stealing patterns here: write paths should be boring, read paths can be creative. The book makes it hard to hand-wave about replication when you see every trade-off side by side.

I keep a running checklist from each chapter and pair it with real traces from my side projects. The “don’t guess, measure” drumbeat is good medicine for feature creep.
