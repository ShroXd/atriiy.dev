The crossing over the ice still stings. Trust happens in small, risky trades, not speeches. I reread the journey chapters when I feel impatient with slow collaboration.

Le Guin’s descriptions make me think about interface writing too: spare, intentional, no wasted gesture. If a line doesn’t move the story or the feeling forward, it melts away.
