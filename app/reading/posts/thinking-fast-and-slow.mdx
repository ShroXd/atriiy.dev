Naming the two systems gives me a quick check during code reviews: am I reacting out of habit or actually weighing the evidence? Writing down the gut reaction first and then challenging it keeps me from nitpicking.

The book is also a reminder to design guardrails for future me: defaults, clear affordances, and fewer places to slip into “fast” mistakes on sleepy days.
