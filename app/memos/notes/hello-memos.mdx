Just tweaked the website design and fixed some existing bugs. The blog looks much better now. But colors feel a bit dull, maybe I need to add some darker tones.

Finished the last blog post about _How Rolldown Works_, and sent a PR to refactor and tweak the documentation. It feels like I've found an open-source project that aligns with my skills and interests.

Being back in my hometown makes me feel more refreshed, had a good time with friends yesterday, we talked just like we did 20 years ago.
