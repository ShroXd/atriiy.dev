description: 'How I rebuilt my blog in 2025 with Next.js and Vercelâ€”from my early days with Hexo to using modern tools like MDX and Tailwind. A personal story about tech, design, and everything in between.'

---

6 years ago, I start learning programming. The first thing I built is a personal blog, because I heared from other people that a good programmer should have a personal website. Although I only have a few knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I still tried to search on google about how to build a website via some existing tools.

I tried a lot of tools and choose [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) + GitHub page as the final choice. Hexo has a big community, people developed a lot of great theme based on it. And GitHub page is a service provided by GitHub allowing people deploy their static page without any costs.

Everything works well, Hexo & theme code has good documention to describe how to tweak the title, introduction, footer information, seo, color, background image, etc. I also tried to write some [stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) code to tweak the UI details. I spent almost 5 days to make everything works, though 5 days includes the time I spent on video games :D.

Today, tech stack we use in the frontend domain has changed totally -- classic -- and there are a lot of great tools compare several years before. Altough I rebuilt the website several times, let's pretend that is doesn't exist.

Basically, the blog website you're reading now is my latest stable version, hopefully. I use several framework and library to build it, and it would be interesting to share the things I used. I don't if this website can existing to next 6 year, but it would be interesting to look back at that moment.

## Server & Basic Frameworks

Basically, for a personal blog website, I have several key requirements:

- Basic support for SEO and Markdown
- Fast & easy to used pipeline (who want to deploy website manually in 2025?)
- FREE!

After some comparing, I choose [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The most boring tech stack at the moment. Because I'm lazy, I use the template provided by Vercel, [Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/new/shroxds-projects/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit).

Vercel is a widly used cloud plateform, and has good integration with GitHub. I can create the website and deploy it to production via on click. For the pure frontend project, this plateform is almost best place to put. I believe no one want to use AWS and receive an expensive bill at the end of the month after a whole bunch of fancy operations.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the most discussed full-stack framework in the frontend developer community, although most of them are complaining. The template based on Next.js, provides some good feature which can save my time to setup:

- MDX support
- Optimized for SEO
- Out-of-box RSS feed support
- Tailwind v4

MDX is supported via [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote), it works like magic, has ability to load MDX file from any place, like another repo, database, etc. The template use React Server Component mode by default. You can read the source code of this library to understand the implementation, but basically, it treats the MDX as data. Compile it at server, pass the result to frontend, and apply custom render component during client hydration stage.

With this library, the article is not just a tons of boring text. I can utilize it to build some amazing interactive component to explain the complex concepts. With some cool technology like Canvas, WebGL, wasm, nothing is impossible.

Of course, I also add some plugins from community to support:

- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/). Use simple text-based syntax to create flowcharts, diagrams, and other visualizations
- [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). For rendering mathematical expressions and equations on web using LaTeX syntax
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). Comments system based on GitHub Discussions

## Design

I think the most interesting thing about the personal blog website is the wide range of design. People always have different prepective about _good_ design.

In my pointof view, for a blog website, the reading experience should be the first class of website design. A good color pattern and font family combination can affect the reading experience significantly. Especially the blog website, a paper-like reading experience should be a good direction.

After some investigation and tweaks, here is the final version. I didn't design the dark mode, it's much more difficult than I expected. Maybe I (my AI team) will do it in the future.

| Role             | Description                                      | Color                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Background       | Main background of the site                      | <Color>#f2f2e3</Color> |
| Text Color       | Primary font color for body text                 | <Color>#3a3a33</Color> |
| Primary Accent   | Decorative color for first letters or highlights | <Color>#a51c30</Color> |
| Secondary Accent | Used for quotes, icons, subtle highlights        | <Color>#6e7554</Color> |

And the typography.

| Font Sample                                                                        | Name & Usage                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| <NunitoSansWrapper>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</NunitoSansWrapper> | UI elements â€” buttons, navigation, links |
| <MontserratWrapper>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</MontserratWrapper> | Section & chapter titles â€” for structure |
| <SpectralWrapper>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</SpectralWrapper>     | Body text for comfortable reading        |
| <MapleMonoWrapper>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</MapleMonoWrapper>   | Programming code                         |

Basically, the whole website use the warm color scheme and mix of two sans-serifs (Nunito Sans and Montserrat) and a serif font (Spectral). Make sure the main color pattern match the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) pattern. Maybe you want to ask why just the _main color pattern_? Because some third party components is hard to tweaks the color. ðŸ˜£ Maybe I will find a time to tweaks them together.

In addition to fonts and color pattern, the transition animations are also an important part of a website. Especially I'm a frontend developer, Nowadays, in the React community, there are many great libraries and tools to do it easily.

- [Motion](https://motion.dev/). Animation library, built on native browser APIs.
- [reactbits](https://www.reactbits.dev/). A collection of animated, interactive, and fully customizable React components.
- [animate.style](https://animate.style/). A collection of out-of-box, cross-browser animations.
- [Easing Wizard](https://easingwizard.com/). Great tool to generate and customize CSS easing functions.

I didn't learn the UX design systematically at school (although I also didn't learn programming systematically at school ðŸ˜…). But with the help of AI and coffee, at least I made something.

## AI Audio

I learn Material Science and Technology at school. Material science research is keen to add Graphene to various material and then claimed to have discovered a new generation of super material. If you haven't touched Graphene, you're embarrassed to say hello to others. Now for programming domain, AI is that Graphene, so of course I have add it.

Google has a super powerful AI product -- [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). It's an AI-powered research assistant designed to help people summarize, analyze, and generate insights from document, notes, website, and YouTube. My favorite feature of it is the Audio Overview. It can generate a podcast-like audio, it's a male and female voice taking in a chat-like manner about the resource you give. It was not a mechanical retelling, the voices of both parties were full of emotion, and they took turns to guide the conversation.

But Google doesn't provide official API to generate the audio in real-time. So I use manually way to add it in my website -- post the article to NotebookLM, generate the audio and download it, load the audio on the website.

There are many resources hosting website, after some investigation and budget review, I choose [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/). It's a AWS S3-compatible object storage service, but with zero egress fees. It means R2 bucket does not charge users for the data transferred out of the storage service to the internet or other destinations.

For the audio player, I use [Plyr](https://plyr.io/). It's a beautiful player based on [Vidstack](https://vidstack.io/), support both video and audio. There is a React binding [plyr-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plyr-react) I can directly use it to integrate. The user experience is very smooth.

## Interactive component

When I was writing the article about video encoding and decoding, I need to explain a complex concept: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization. To be honest, it's hard enough for me to pronounce these words, let alone explain them. So I asked my AI team, ChatGPT says you can build a interactive component to explain it, Gemini help me to gather the resources from internet, Grok optimized the plan, DeepSeek reviewed the plan, and Claude finished code implementation. Finally, I input `pnpm run dev` to run the website. ðŸ˜‰

Benefit from perfect teamwork, we use pure [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to build [an interactive component](https://www.atriiy.dev/blog/encoding-and-decoding#quantization) to explain DCT and quantization, you can check the source code at [here](https://github.com/ShroXd/atriiy.dev/blob/main/app/components/DCTVisualization.tsx).

Because it includes many mathematical calculation, therefore it's a perfect domain to do vibe coding. But I still learnt basic Canvas API before starting it. Basically, what we did in this component is create a Canvas Context via `const ctx = canvas.getContext('2D')`, and call the API of the context to draw path, circle, rectangle; fill the area; setup the styles of each elements; handle mouse events; and run all of these via `useEffect` to integrate with React. You can find the document on the internet.

But as you can see, use pure API to develop such component is painful, although Claude doesn't complain this to me, but I can still get it from frequent prompts to use a new convo to avoid the current convo from being too long.

[Konva](https://konvajs.org/) would be the best choice for React & TS user. Me and Claude don't have plan to rewrite the existing DCT visualization component based on Konva, but maybe I will try it in the future.

## What's next

Well, it's hard to say what will happen for my personal blog website. Steve Jobs used to say a sentence on stanford commencement address: Stay hungry, Stay foolish. Although I'm writing this article on Arch Linux, I still hope I can do it and record my journey at here.

And it would be better to remember to pay the $20 per year domain fee.
