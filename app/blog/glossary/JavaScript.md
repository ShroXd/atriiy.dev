# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used for web development, both on the client-side and server-side.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold values of any type without explicit declaration
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
- **Prototype-Based**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **Event-Driven**: Ideal for handling user interactions and asynchronous operations

## Basic Example

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

// Arrow function (ES6+)
const add = (a, b) => a + b

// Object with methods
const calculator = {
  multiply: (x, y) => x * y,
  divide: (x, y) => x / y
}
```

## Core Concepts

1. **Variables** - `var`, `let`, `const` for storing data
2. **Functions** - Reusable blocks of code
3. **Objects** - Collections of key-value pairs
4. **Arrays** - Ordered lists of values
5. **Promises** - Handling asynchronous operations
6. **DOM Manipulation** - Interacting with web page elements

## Modern Features (ES6+)

- **Template Literals** - String interpolation with backticks
- **Destructuring** - Extract values from arrays/objects
- **Modules** - Import/export code between files
- **Async/Await** - Cleaner asynchronous code

> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has evolved from a simple scripting language to one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
