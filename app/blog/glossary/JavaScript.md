**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used for web development, both on the client-side and server-side.

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold values of any type without explicit declaration
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions
- **Prototype-Based**: Objects can inherit directly from other objects
- **Event-Driven**: Ideal for handling user interactions and asynchronous operations

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

// Arrow function (ES6+)
const add = (a, b) => a + b

// Object with methods
const calculator = {
  multiply: (x, y) => x * y,
  divide: (x, y) => x / y
}
```
